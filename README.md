# Billing-System
Java Mini Project

## ABSTRACT
The project “Bakery Billing System” is an automated system designed for a Bakery to generate the bills to be paid by the customers. The user should login to the system by specifying the credentials required for identification. The bakery items along with the price are displayed. The user is required to specify the quantity of each commodity required. The user can specify the choices over a variety of chat, snacks, sandwiches and cakes. The bill is generated specifying the bill number, user name and mobile number for identification along with a detailed description of the transaction amount to be paid by the user.

## INTRODUCTION
